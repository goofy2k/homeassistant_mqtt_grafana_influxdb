# homeassistant_mqtt_grafana_influxdb
 
 Walkthrough of: https://diyi0t.com/home-assistant-mqtt-tutorial/
 
 FOCUS ON MQTT first !   Your main goal is to have remote ESP devices!
 Later, later, later have a look at influx db / grafana.  This can also be a Nodered project!
 
 For Docker:
 
 Installation of grafana and influxdb via Docker:  https://diyi0t.com/home-assistant-raspberry-pi-docker-setup/
 
 Followed by: https://diyi0t.com/visualize-mqtt-data-with-influxdb-and-grafana/
 
 How to set/edit influxdb user,database, configuration?
 
 Is this possible
 
 - via commands in a (Docker) terminal screen?
 - by editing config file(s) in external volume?
 - other?
 
 
 Influx Docker docs: https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/influxdb/README.md (docs in the Docker repository is not complete due to space limitations!)

"InfluxDB can be configured using a mix of a config file, environment variables, and CLI options. To mount a configuration file and use it with the server, you can use this command to generate the default configuration file: ....."
 
 
The blog uses an MQTT "bridge" written in python. This bridge subscribes to MQTT messages sent by the ESP devices and sends the data to the influxdb database.
This bridge function could possibly be implemented in Nodered.




Grafana contains a tutorial: https://grafana.com/tutorials/grafana-fundamentals/?utm_source=grafana_gettingstarted 

Investigate difference in using sensor in mqtt enabled device code and mqtt settings in ha configuration file.
